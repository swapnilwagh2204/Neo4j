Neo4j memory configs:

Memory configuration for a Neo4j instance is crucial for achieving optimal performance and is dependent on your workload. 

For mixed workloads:

Here's a suggested configuration based on the given memory and the Neo4j documentation:

1. **Page Cache**:
   
   - Page cache is used to cache the graph's nodes, relationships, and properties. 
   - A recommended starting point is 50% of available RAM for machines with up to 32 GB of RAM. Given your machine has 24 GB, you might want to start with 12 GB.
   
     ```
     dbms.memory.pagecache.size=12g
     ```

2. **Heap Size**:

   - The heap is used by Neo4j for query processing and other computations.
   - It's generally suggested that for a 24 GB system, setting heap size between 4 GB to 8 GB is a good starting point. Let's take the mid-point.
   
     ```
     dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=6g
     dbms.memory.heap.max_size=6g
     ```

3. **Transaction State**:
   
   - Memory for transaction state is allocated outside of the configured heap size. 
   - According to the Neo4j docs, peak allocations can go up to 2 GB for write-intensive operations. However, considering your total available memory, a reservation of 1 GB should be sufficient.
   - No specific configuration needed, but ensure enough memory is left outside of heap and page cache.

4. **System and Other Services**:
   
   - After allocating for the Page Cache, Heap, and expected transaction states, you should reserve memory for the OS and other services. For a 24 GB system, reserving around 4 GB for system processes is recommended.

Given this breakdown:

- Page Cache: 12 GB
- Heap: 6 GB
- Transaction State: ~1 GB (allocated outside heap)
- System and Other Services: ~5 GB (including a buffer)

**Note**: These are starting points. Depending on the nature of your workload (read-heavy, write-heavy, mixed), you may need to adjust these settings. Monitoring the system under real workloads and adjusting based on actual usage is recommended. Always ensure to test configurations in a staging environment before applying them to a production server.




For write-heavy workloads:

If your workload is write-heavy, there are several considerations you'll need to take into account:

1. **Transaction State**:
   
   - Write-heavy workloads result in larger transaction states. The more simultaneous writes, the more memory is used to track these changes before they're committed to the database.
   - Ensure that there's sufficient memory available outside of the heap to accommodate the peak transaction state.

2. **Heap Size**:

   - With more writes, there will be an increased load on the heap due to the handling of write operations, transactional updates, and temporary object creation.
   - Thus, allocating a larger portion of the memory to the heap might be beneficial.
   
3. **Page Cache**:

   - While the page cache is generally more important for read operations, when data is written, it also goes through the page cache. Hence, reducing this slightly can be an option to accommodate more heap space or transaction state, but don't reduce it too much.

Considering the above and the available 24 GB RAM on your EC2 instance, here's a revised configuration:

```
# Increase heap size to support more concurrent write transactions and related computations
dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=8g
dbms.memory.heap.max_size=8g

# Slightly reduce the page cache size to accommodate the larger heap and potential transaction state
dbms.memory.pagecache.size=10g
```

Leave around 6 GB for the system, other services, and transaction states (which can be large for write-heavy operations).

Again, these are general guidelines. Even within write-heavy workloads, the specifics can vary greatly depending on transaction sizes, number of concurrent writes, and other factors. It's crucial to monitor the performance and adjust as necessary, and always test new configurations in a non-production environment first.
